### About
The objective of this website is to present my professional experience and academic training in a clear and accessible way.

### Technologies
The website was developed using a combination of Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a seamless and dynamic user experience. You can explore the live site [here](https://estefani-a.github.io/portfolio/) to witness these technologies in action.
